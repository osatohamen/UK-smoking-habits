The overarching goal of my analysis is to identify trends and patterns in smoking habits across different variables. By delving into this dataset, I aim to answer key questions that shed light on the dynamics of smoking behavior in the UK. My inquiry spans a variety of dimensions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of how different factors may influence smoking habits. The chosen dataset encompasses a range of demographic variables, such as sex, age, marital status, highest education qualification, race, income e.t.c. Analyzing how these socio-economic factors correlate with smoking behavior can contribute to a nuanced understanding of the determinants of smoking in the UK.
